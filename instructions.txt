Implement an infinite scrollable that loads products from the endpoint 

Endpoint: https://run.mocky.io/v3/05e9651d-528e-4d7c-a60b-bae8f09684c6

Please keep the following in mind while designing:

1. Use the above api to get the products, price, discount and other details.

2. Render only what all is visible ( as per the view port )

3. Keep header as sticky ( while scrolling, header should not move )

4. Added image only for your reference, use your imagination to beautify this or you can completely redesign this.

5. Click on 'Add to cart' should add an item in the cart. Take the user to the 'Cart page' once the Cart icon is clicked (next route/page), add a back button in the Cart page.

6. Keep the Index and Cart state maintained. Use Redux for store.

7. Writing custom CSS will be an additional plus. ( refrain from using any third party styling like: bootstrap, material ui etc. )

8. Build responsive UI that should load perfectly fine in Mobile, Desktop and Tablet

9. Write modular, scalable and quality code
